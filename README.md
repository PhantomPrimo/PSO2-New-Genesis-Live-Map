.. and much more straight from your browser outside of the game!

Not only that, but our team of collaborators and with the help of the community we are verifying all the data on the map every single day to keep it updated with the latest valid information so you can't be misled at all!


## Data on each region:
Aside from the locations our map also lets you select specific regions to get various information
* Type of Enemies you can encounter
